		<div class="headline_1"><h2>Orcs from Warcraft </h2></div>
	 
		<p class="origins">Orcs are one of the most important races in the Warcraft computer game series. Originally presented as a race of typically savage monsters, more recent Warcraft games have revised their image into that of "savage but noble" warriors and shamans. Orcs originally hailed from the world of Draenor until the majority of the clans were tricked into serving a force of world-destroying demons, named the Burning Legion. Under the Legion's influence, the Orcish Horde slaughtered their onetime allies the Draenei and then were mystically transported to Azeroth to conquer it in the Legion's name. After two devastating wars, the orcs were finally defeated by the Human Alliance and rounded up into internment camps.

	<h3>Orcs are Humanoid </h3>

	<p class="origins">Warcraft orcs are humanoid, but prodigiously muscled, with broad noses and distinctive tusked mouths. There are many tribes of Orc, each one being specialized: Frostwolves serves as cavalry with their dire wolves, while the Shadowmoon clan provides powerful shamans. The Orcs originally had brown skin, but demonic corruption turned it green, and further demonic influence can turn it red. Male Orcs are significantly larger than humans, around 6.5 feet (2.0 m) tall when standing straight, however most male Orcs have a hunched back. Females, which first appeared as playable characters in World of Warcraft, are slightly larger than a human female and while much more slender than their male counterparts, are nonetheless well-muscled. The tusks of female orcs are very small, and are arguably more exaggerated canines than tusks. Orc warriors wear little armor but have horned helmets and carry wielding axes.  </p>


    <p class="origins">Warcraft is one of the few settings in which orcs are not inherently evil and, after significant plot developments in the latest Warcraft games, can even be heroic. One could consider the orcs to be unfairly treated by humans and not only misunderstood, but vilified. The humans' enmity and prejudice towards the Orcs can be traced back to the first and second invasions and could be partially justified, as it was orcs under the control of the Burning Legion that invaded. Despite the best efforts of reformist orcs (such as Thrall) to usher in an era of peace between humans and orcs, humankind's suspicions towards the orcs are further exacerbated by the bellicose and expansionist attitudes of parts of orc society, such as the Warsong Clan, who encroach upon the ancestral territories of the Night Elves, the allies of the humans. Thrall's orcs have occasionally formed successful alliances with humans. </p>
